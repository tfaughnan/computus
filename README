Obfuscated C code for calculating the date of Easter, in the Gregorian calendar
(obviously!). This implementation uses the algorithm published in _Nature_ in
1876. Don't expect accuracy for prior centuries or the very far future. If
there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that calendars are _weird_. The obfuscation
of the code is meh, but it's my first real attempt at that sort of thing.

Build the program:
$ make

Run the program:
$ ./computus 1907
1907-03-31
$ ./computus 2022
2022-04-17
# ./computus 2049
2049-04-18

Compilation has been tested on Arch Linux with GCC 11.2.0, Clang 13.0.1, and TCC
0.9.27.
